## 下屬向上司提交報告

    Dear Mr. Smith,

        I've investigated the matter of maintaining versus outsourcing the IT
    support and services, and it seems to far more cost-effective in the long run for
    us to outsource out IT system rather than to maintain it by ourselves.

        A quality IT outsourced company will have sufficient resources and
    manpower to implement new technology in a timely manner.

        Therefore, in order to stay focused on our core business instead of
    getting annoyed by complex IT decisions, I suggest outsourcing the IT management.

        We are looking forward to hearing from you.

    Leon
